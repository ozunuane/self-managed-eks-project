Setting up Ansible to deploy kubernetes
On the Ansible Server, as Ansible user

#1 mkdir kubernetes

#2 cd kubernetes

#3 vi hosts (Modify with the correct IP addresses when created)
See Ansible-K8S directory here

#4 Confirm hosts response
ansible -i hosts all -m ping

#5 Creating a Kubernetes user with Ansible Playbook

#6 vi users.yml
See Ansible-K8S directory here

#7 Run
ansible-playbook -i hosts users.yml

#8 Install Kubernetes with Ansible Playbook

#9 vi install-k8s.yml
See Ansible-K8S directory here

#10 Run
ansible-playbook -i hosts install-k8s.yml

#11 Creating a Kubernetes Cluster Master Node using Ansible Playbook

#12 vi master.yml
See Ansible-K8S directory here

#13a. Edit /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg;
And uncomment line 280, and change it to 'True'. This enables the ansible user to create the #kubeconfig file.

#13b Run
ansible-playbook -i hosts master.yml
 
#14. Using SSH, check the master Node
Recall that kube user was added, so switch
sudo su - kube
kubectl get nodes
This should confirm that the Master node is configured and ready.

#15 Join Worker Nodes to Kubernetes Cluster using Ansible Playbook

#16 vi join-workers.yml
See Ansible-K8S directory here

#17 Run
ansible-playbook -i hosts join-workers.yml

#18. Using SSH, check the master Node
Recall that kube user was added, so switch
sudo su - kube
kubectl get nodes
This should confirm that the Master node and Worker nodes are fully configured and ready.
