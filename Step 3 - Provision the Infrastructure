Using Terraform to provision infrastructure in AWS Cloud

Initial steps:
a. mkdir terraform-k8s && cd terraform-k8s
b. Create all the files in the Terraform-K8S directory in this repository
c. Inspect all the files and edit as necessary

#1. Create a new Terraform workspace
terraform workspace list           --> will show all the workspace
terraform workspace show           --> will show the current workspace
terraform workspace new aws_prod   --> creating new workspace

#2. AWS configure
aws configure --profile <user_name>
And fill in the Access key and Secret key ID for the IAM user created.
The profile appears in .aws/credentials file. This is the profile name you would fill in the provider resource block.

#3. terraform init

#4. terraform validate

#5. terraform plan
